🏥 **MediCare+**

**Hospital Management System (React & ES6 Focused)**


📌 **Project Overview**

MediCare+ is a modern hospital management web application built with a strong focus on React and ES6 JavaScript modules. The application provides a clean and responsive interface for managing hospital operations such as patients, doctors, appointments, medicines, and administrative tasks.

The project emphasizes component-based architecture, modular JavaScript, and real-world frontend development practices used in production applications.

🛠️ **Technology Stack**

🎨 **Frontend (React & ES6)**

	•	React
	
	•	JavaScript (ES6+)
	
	•	ES6 Modules (import / export)
	
	•	Functional Components
	
	•	React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
	
	•	React Router (client-side routing)
	
	•	Axios (API communication)
	
	•	HTML5 & CSS3
	
	•	Material UI
	
	•	Bootstrap

⚙️ **Backend**

	•	Node.js
	
	•	Express.js
	
	•	JSON Web Token (JWT)
	
	•	bcrypt (password hashing)

🗄️ **Database**

	•	MongoDB
	
	•	Mongoose



🧩 **React & ES6 Architecture**

The frontend is structured using ES6 modules, where each component, service, and utility is maintained as a separate module.

	•	Each UI feature is implemented as a React functional component
	
	•	Logic is separated into reusable components and services
	
	•	ES6 import and export statements are used for clean dependency management
	
	•	State and side effects are managed using React Hooks

    •   This modular structure improves maintainability, readability, and scalability.


🧭 **Usage (React & JavaScript)**

🌐 **Application Load**

	•	The application loads as a single-page application (SPA).
	
	•	React renders components dynamically without full page reloads.
	
	•	Routing between pages is handled on the client side using React Router.

🖱️ **Component Interaction**

	•	User actions such as clicks and form submissions are handled using JavaScript event handlers.
	
	•	Forms are implemented as controlled components using React state.
	
	•	UI updates automatically when state changes.

🔄 API Communication

	•	Axios is used to send HTTP requests from React components.
	
	•	API calls are triggered inside useEffect hooks where required.
	
	•	Response data is stored in component state and rendered dynamically.

🔐 Authentication Handling

	•	After login, JWT tokens are stored on the client side.
	
	•	Tokens are attached to API requests for secure access.
	
	•	Components are conditionally rendered based on authentication state.

📱 Responsive UI

	•	Layout and components adapt to different screen sizes.
	
	•	Material UI and Bootstrap are used for consistent styling.



🔐 Authentication & Security

	•	JWT-based authentication for secure login
	
	•	Passwords encrypted using bcrypt
	
	•	Protected routes using authentication checks
	
	•	Role-based UI rendering in React



🚀 **Getting Started**

✅ **Prerequisites**

	•	Node.js
	
	•	npm or Yarn
	
	•	MongoDB



📦 **Installation & Setup**
